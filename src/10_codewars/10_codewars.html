  //Task 1
  //Make a function that returns the value multiplied by 50 and increased by 6.
  // If the value entered is a string it should return "Error".
const problem = (x) => {
  return (typeof x) === 'string' ? 'Error' : x*50+6;
}

console.log(problem(5));


  //Task 2
  //Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ),
  // except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).
  //The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge,
  // even if there are more than one with the same value. Mind the input validation.
  //Input validation
  //If an empty value ( null, None, Nothing etc. ) is given instead of an array,
  // or the given array is an empty list or a list with only 1 element, return 0.
